            <p>
                Customer service has great significance in the banking industry. The banking system in India today has perhaps the largest outreach for delivery of financial services and is also serving as an important conduit for delivery of financial services. While the coverage has been expanding day by day, the quality and content of dispensation of customer service has come under tremendous pressure mainly owing to the failure to handle the soaring demands and expectations of the customers.

The vast network of branches spread over the entire country with millions of customers, a complex variety of products and services offered, the varied institutional framework – all these add to the enormity and complexity of banking operations in India giving rise to complaints for deficiencies in services. This is evidenced by a series of studies conducted by various committees such as the Talwar Committee, Goiporia Committee, Tarapore Committee, etc., to bring in improvement in performance and procedure involved in the dispensation of hassle-free customer service.

Reserve Bank, as the regulator of the banking sector, has been actively engaged from the very beginning in the review, examination and evaluation of customer service in banks. It has constantly brought into sharp focus the inadequacy in banking services available to the common person and the need to benchmark the current level of service, review the progress periodically, enhance the timeliness and quality, rationalize the processes taking into account technological developments, and suggest appropriate incentives to facilitate change on an ongoing basis through instructions/guidelines.

Depositors' interest forms the focal point of the regulatory framework for banking in India. There is a widespread feeling that the customer does not get satisfactory service even after demanding it and there has been a total disenfranchisement of the depositor. There is, therefore, a need to reverse this trend and start a process of empowering the depositor.

Broadly, a customer can be defined as a user or a potential user of bank services. So defined, a ‘Customer’ may include:

a person or entity that maintains an account and/or has a business relationship with the bank;

one on whose behalf the account is maintained (i.e. the beneficial owner);

beneficiaries of transactions conducted by professional intermediaries, such as Stock Brokers, Chartered Accountants, Solicitors, etc., as permitted under the law, and

any person or entity connected with a financial transaction which can pose significant reputational or other risks to the bank, say, a wire transfer or issue of a high value demand draft as a single transaction.

                 Banks were advised in November 2005 to make available a basic banking 'no-frills' account either with 'nil' or very low minimum balance as well as charges that would make such accounts accessible to vast sections of population. With a view to doing away with the stigma associated with the nomenclature ‘no-frills’ account and making the basic banking facilities available in a more uniform manner across banking system, it has been decided to modify the guidelines on opening of basic banking ‘no-frills’ accounts. Accordingly, in supersession of instructions contained in circular DBOD.No.Leg.BC. 44/09.07.005/2005-06 dated November 11, 2005 on Financial Inclusion, banks are advised to offer a ‘Basic Savings Bank Deposit Account’ which will offer following minimum common facilities to all their customers:

i. The ‘Basic Savings Bank Deposit Account’ should be considered a normal banking service available to all.

ii. This account shall not have the requirement of any minimum balance.

iii. The services available in the account will include deposit and withdrawal of cash at bank branch as well as ATMs; receipt/credit of money through electronic payment channels or by means of deposit/collection of cheques drawn by Central/State Government agencies and departments;

iv. While there will be no limit on the number of deposits that can be made in a month, account holders will be allowed a maximum of four withdrawals in a month, including ATM withdrawals; and

v. Facility of ATM card or ATM-cum-Debit Card;

3. The above facilities will be provided without any charges.  Further, no charge will be levied for non-operation/activation of in-operative ‘Basic Savings Bank Deposit Account’.

4. Banks would be free to evolve other requirements including pricing structure for additional value-added services beyond the stipulated basic minimum services on reasonable and transparent basis and applied in a non-discriminatory manner.
